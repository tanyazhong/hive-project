# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# future improvements i might make 
1. fun color schemes
2. certain parts of the Dropdown component are a bit repetitive and can be broken down into smaller components (ex: a list item component)
3. animation when opening/closing the dropdown to make it a smooth motion
